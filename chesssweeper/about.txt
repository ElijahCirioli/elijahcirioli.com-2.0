5:T516,There’s a lot of opportunities for UI improvement surrounding the temporal aspect of the game. Because pieces obstruct other pieces you can learn a lot by seeing how the numbers of a piece change when you block its sight in different directions. Once the number changes, it never goes back to what it was before, so you need to make sure that you remember what it was. If you wanted to show someone a still frame of the game for help they could treat it as a self-contained puzzle, but it would really help them to know that different pieces used to display different numbers. I’m not quite sure how best to remedy this problem, but you can get part of the way there just by marking cells as safe or dangerous. One solution would just be to add in a tool for looking back through the history of the game to see how things have evolved, similar to what I have on my public chess board. Another solution could be a highlight representing where you’ve just placed a piece and something indicating that the number of a piece has just gone down because of that move. This would mean conveying more information with highlights and the piece numbers which are already doing too much so I don’t really like it. I will have to think more about whether there is an elegant way to convey this information.0:["VahvSBvB51ltAuiGTYk7U",[[["",{"children":["chesssweeper",{"children":["about",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["chesssweeper",{"children":["about",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},["$L1",[["$","header",null,{"id":"Header_header__b54d9","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","id":"Header_logo__n5fo7","children":["$","$L3",null,{"src":"/logo.png","alt":"Elijah Cirioli logo","width":100,"height":57}]}],["$","div",null,{"id":"Header_settingsWrap__34Ks_","children":["$","$L4",null,{}]}],["$","h1",null,{"id":"Header_title__T4REj","className":"__className_bf4fce","children":["elijah",["$","span",null,{"className":"Header_greenText__MS_3t","children":"cirioli"}]]}]]}],["$","main",null,{"id":"TextWrap_textWrap__9_kIy","className":"__className_b1da2a","children":[["$","div",null,{"id":"TextWrap_titleWrap__HFi0_","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"__className_bf4fce","children":"About Chess Sweeper"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Fall 2022"}]]}],["$","hr",null,{}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["For some reason that I can’t quite remember, I had a moment a few years ago where I envisioned a series of different chess-related projects that I wanted to create.

Many of the other chess ideas I had at the time involved mashing up chess with other other games and concepts which is a pretty common way for me to generate project ideas. I think that some of these ideas like Rubik’s cube chess could be really interesting to theorize and strategize about, but wouldn’t actually be very fun to play. The one idea that I actually started in the Spring of 2021 was a mashup of chess and minesweeper. This was a good first target since it isn’t too ambitious. After all, minesweeper is a fairly simple game to implement."]}],["$","p",null,{"children":["Despite this being a simpler project, I never finished it at the time.

In regular minesweeper you are more or less just performing a fairly simple algorithm over and over, but I think chess sweeper has another level of depth and strategy to it.

The biggest issue I think is that there is just so much information packed inside of the little squares on the board. It can be difficult to distinguish the pieces and the numbers, especially when the squares are very small. I don’t have a good solution to this, but I’m sure somebody else could come up with one.
