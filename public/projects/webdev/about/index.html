							<strong>Name: </strong>Elijah Cirioli<br />
							<strong>Pronouns: </strong>He/him<br />
							<strong>Email: </strong>
							<a class="link" href="mailto: ciriolie@oregonstate.edu"
								>ciriolie@oregonstate.edu</a
							><br />
							<strong>Major: </strong>Freshman studying computer science <br /><br />
							<strong>Most complicated webdev project: </strong>I don't really make a lot of
							websites but I do a lot of javascript programming.
							<a class="link" href="/" target="_blank">I have another site</a>
							that's a lot like this one where I post about some of those projects. One of the
							more complicated ones is a
							<a class="link" href="/raytracing/" target="_blank">3D raytracing engine</a>
							I made from scratch in 2019. It's anything but efficient, but it was exciting to
							make and I think the end result is really cool.<br /><br />
							<strong>What do I hope to learn: </strong>I have never taken any classes on
							html/css or on any kind of Node.js backend stuff so everything that I do is
							probably not best practice. I want to learn the best conventions of web
							development, especially for the backend stuff. Maybe I've been doing HTTP requests
							wrong this whole time.<br /><br />
							<strong>Have I signed up for Campuswire: </strong>Heck yeah I have! <br /><br />
							<strong>Most unique experience: </strong>I do a lot of camping and I love to go to
							national parks. I've visted maybe 20 different parks and I'd have to say my
							favorite is probably Glacier National Park in Montana. I drove up there a few
							years ago and then drove into Canada to see Banff which was also beautiful. We saw
							a lot of bears which was a little scary but it was an incredible experience.
