				<p class="about-text">
					This website was developed by
					<a href="https://github.com/Starbuck5" target="_blank">Charlie Hayden</a> and
					<a href="/" target="_blank">Elijah Cirioli</a> as part of their CS 340 Databases class at
					Oregon State University. It was designed to be a useful, community-driven tool for finding
					amenities around the OSU campus that may be hard to find on traditional car-oriented
					navigation services. It's usefulness is not limited to the OSU campus however, as people
					anywhere in the world are able to post data about their locations and review the posts of
					others around them.
				</p>
				<p class="about-text">
					It incorporates a PostgreSQL database connected to a Node.js backend to handle the storing
					and retrieval of the different markers. The Google Maps API is used for the actual maps
					while front-end javascript code handles creating the markers and populating the user
					interface elements. The source code can be viewed
					<a href="https://github.com/ElijahCirioli/minimap" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.
				</p>
				<h1 class="about-title">How to use</h1>
				<p class="about-text">
					This service is entirely community-driven which means that anyone is able to add or modify
					the database that everyone uses. Users can create new markers, modify the attributes of
					existing ones, leave reviews, or report inappropriate or inaccurate content to be removed.
					To view markers near you, either allow the website to track your location or type in your
					current location in the search box. The six different types of markers will be seen on the
					map marking the location of what they represent. There are five different markers that
					represent specific things and a sixth that can be used to represent things that don't fall
					into the five categories. The filter tool can be used to only show specific types of
					markers on the map.
				</p>
				<p class="about-text">
					Clicking on a marker will reveal more details about it as well as reviews from other
					users. Each type of marker has specific attributes associated with it. These may be
					whether something exists like whether a bathroom has a baby-changing station, or something
					less binary like the collection time of a postal drop box. When creating a marker you will
					have the option to set these attributes, leaving them as "unknown" if you aren't sure
					about the required information. Other people can edit these attributes if they have more
					information or if something changes by clicking "edit" in the marker info window.
				</p>
				<p class="about-text">
					Editing can usually fix small innaccuracies, but if the existence of the marker itself is
					incorrect, whether it be vandalism or simply the object it's referencing being removed,
					then the marker should be deleted. This can be done through reporting a marker by clicking
					"report" in the marker info window. This will let you enter some information explaining
					your report before submitting it. After enough valid reports have been filed a marker will
					be removed automatically.
				</p>
				<p class="about-text">
					Creating a marker is not much different from editing one. The purple plus sign button
					allows you to choose which type of marker to create, and you can then move it around on
					the map and edit it's attributes. Clicking "confirm" will add the marker to the public
					database, making it visible to others. It's good to check whether a marker already exists
					for something before making a new one yourself.
				</p>
				<p class="about-text">
					Anyone can leave a maximum of one review for every marker. These must include a star
					rating out of five and can optionally include text describing your experience with the
					amenity or helpful information for others seeking to use it. The average star rating and
					all of the textual reviews are visible alongside the marker properties in the information
					window. Just as with markers, inappropriate or inaccurate content in reviews can be
					reported which will lead to a review being removed.
