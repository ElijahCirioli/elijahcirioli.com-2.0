							I’ve used express a lot in the past but I had never used handlebars before so this
							assignment came with lots of new challenges. I expected the client side twit
							template to be the more difficult part because I needed to pre-compile the
							template into regular javascript that can be served to the client. I looked at the
							code from class to figure out how to make a script to compile the template
							whenever I run the server. This ended up being pretty easy and the client side
							code to utilize the template was much shorter than the old version which was nice.
							<br /><br />
							I ended up spending a lot more time on the server side templates. The templates
							and partials were easy enough to make, but it took me a few tries to get the file
							structure right with the proper folders for the layout, views, and partials. Once
							I figured that out, I also had to figure out how layouts actually worked. I had to
							look up some documentation to find the proper keyword for the {{{body}}} tag. I
							really like how easy that makes it to keep the same header and footer for every
							page so I will definitely use them more in the future.
							<br /><br />
							I also think the handlebars expressions are really useful. I used a couple if
							expressions to show and hide certain partials and I used the each expression to
							iterate through all of the twits. This was nice because I could just pass it an
							array of twits and it would display however many there were. This let me reuse all
							the same templates for the page that displays a single twit because all I had to
							do was pass in an array containing only one object.

							I’ve written server code using node.js a couple times before but I usually use
							express so I wasn’t exactly used to the syntax for the normal HTTP module. It
							isn’t that complicated so it wasn’t a big deal. I probably would really be missing
							express if we had to make a very complicated server but for something of this
							scale it doesn’t really matter.
							<br /><br />
							For this we were told to only read the contents of our files once which makes
							sense. I’m not really happy with how I named my variables but I wasn’t really able
							to come up with a better solution. I think in the future, especially if I have a
							larger file system I might structure my variables as one large JSON object. This
							could let me do subdirectories really well I think and I could name the variables
							exactly after the actual URLs. I don’t know if this is what people actually do for
							stuff like this, but that just sounds nice to me.
							<br /><br />
							I would also usually do a lot of asynchronous code using promises for something
							like this. But that’s more if I’m doing database stuff. I decided to keep things
							synchronous for this project for the sake of simplicity. readFileSync() is
							technically not the fastest way to do this. I might use asynchronous reads that I
							run all at once using Promise.all() but the difference for something like this
							would be a couple of milliseconds at most.
							<br /><br />
							That’s about all there is to say for this one. Definitely simple but I liked it. I
							usually prefer backend development.

							This assignment was another pretty easy one just because it’s a lot like what I do
							in my free time. I have been relying pretty heavily on jQuery lately so it took me
							a second to regain my bearings in manipulating the DOM with just vanilla
							javascript but it’s really not that bad. I used the querySelector function a lot
							more than I usually would with this project because there were a lot of unique
							elements that I was trying to find by their class name. I could have used the
							getElementsByClassName() function but then I would need to add a [0] to the end
							and who has time for that?
							<br /><br />
							An interesting little challenge was that we were given twits baked into the HTML
							but we also had to add our own on top of that. Adding a twit could just push it
							into the DOM but we were also told that searching for twits must remove all the
							ones that don’t match completely, rather than just hiding them. What this really
							means to me is that we need to store the twits in javascript behind the scenes. I
							created a class to store a twit which was pretty simple because they’re just some
							text and an author. When the page loads I find all of the twits and look through
							their children to get the author and text. The formatting we were given includes
							newline characters at the beginning of every twit that I needed to remove when I
							imported them into the javascript. I just did this with substring but there’s
							probably better ways that I could do it.
							<br /><br />
							Creating the twits as HTML was a bit time consuming. I used a lot of
							createElement() and appendChild(). I would usually do this as a big template
							string and then sanitize my inputs using jQuery, but for this I had to sanitize
							using the textContent property. This way wasn’t hard, it’s just a lot more lines
							of code than the usual way I would do things.
							<br /><br />
							Another important feature was the search functionality. We were told that it would
							be better to make the search happen live which is nice (and it also renders the
							search button completely useless). I’ve done live searches exactly like this in
							the past. What I might usually do is split the search query into individual words
							and then rank the results by how many of those terms they match but for this we
							were just supposed to match the whole query with either the author or the text. I
							used toLowerCase() to make sure that the search was case insensitive. I also made
							sure to call trim() a bunch of different times in this assignment. When a field
							isn’t supposed to be blank I didn’t want people to be able to just type a space
							and I didn’t want trailing spaces to mess up someone’s search query.
							<br /><br />
							There might be even less to say about this assignment than the last one. It’s some
							pretty standard javascript page interactions. Hopefully the next assignment will
							be a bit more complicated.

							For this project I tried to follow good CSS practices at least to the level that I
							understand what those are. This kind of thing is pretty easy for me because I have
							some experience doing it. I just kinda worked my way down from the header, styling
							things as I went. The mocks provided were pretty decent but I wish they were a
							higher resolution. It’s hard to discern font weights and colors when the image is
							that compressed.
							<br /><br />
							I guess the central question of this assignment was how to display the actual
							twits. I use a lot of flexboxes normally and that may even be what they wanted us
							to do here but I thought this was an application that was better suited for the
							grid layout. I thought this mostly because we wanted all the columns to be the
							same width. I could have done this by setting a min and max width on the twit
							children but that seemed like a worse solution than using grid. I haven’t actually
							worked with grid a lot so I had to look up a little bit about how to autofill them
							columns to fit the available space. I had never used the CSS repeat function
							before but it did the job nicely here. The assignment did say we could only have a
							maximum of 3 columns which is actually not the case with my styling. I couldn’t
							figure out a good way to cap the number of columns without adding more html or
							javascript so I guess it’s just gonna be this way. I do think it’s actually better
							that it can add as many columns as it wants to stay responsive to larger screens.
							On a 1080p screen it should cap out at 3 but I imagine it would be more in 4k.
							<br /><br />
							I had also never used the “fixed” position attribute before but I at least had a
							pretty good idea of what it did. It was a pretty obvious choice for the red button
							because it needs to stay in the same position relative to the viewport. Years ago
							I probably would have done that with javascript but this is undoubtedly better and
							I will probably use it in the future.
							<br /><br />
							One thing I didn’t like was that the html we were given didn’t include a viewport
							tag in the head. This means that we can’t really be sure how big a pixel is,
							especially when we go to different sizes of screen like mobile. I usually use a
							combination of all sorts of units, mainly percentages for widths and then some
							pixels for heights. Because I couldn’t really be guaranteed of a pixel’s size I
							didn’t really want to use them for this project. Instead I used rem for pretty
							much everything here which basically means I was just using pixels with extra
							steps. The nice thing is that if I add a viewport tag down the line then I can do
							media queries and scale all of these pixel values at once which will be really
							nice.
							<br /><br />
							Overall there’s not much to say about this one. It’s pretty simple but it was a
							nice excuse to get more experience with proper CSS practices.

							I usually like to plan out what I want a website to look like before I make it,
							either sketching it in a notebook or drawing it in a vector graphics program. This
							site is really simple so I figured I'd just kinda start making it and see what
							happens. I knew from the start that I wanted this to be distinct from
							<a class="link" href="/" target="_blank">my other site</a>
							which meant that it definitely had to be dark themed and I would need to stay far
							away from the color green. A lot of my sites are usually very boring with a big
							colored rectangle at the top and then all the content displayed vertically beneath
							it. I think that's a super functional design but for this I wanted to do something
							more visually appealing. <br /><br />
							The design I came up to fit all these criteria with started the little mountain
							range. I figured that would be more interesting than just a rectangle and I
							personally think it looks really cool. I could have faked it by making it all an
							image but I decided I would try to do a half-decent job. I drew all the different
							layers of mountains as .svg images so they are infinitely scalable. Those images
							then mask divs of different colors which are layered on top of one another. This
							means that it will look good at any resolution and I can also recolor the mountain
							range however I want using CSS (maybe I’ll add a day/night cycle or something). I
							thought that a yellow would contrast nicely with the shades of blue I had chosen
							and act as a nice accent color. I don’t know if people would consider this to hurt
							the dark theme aspect of the site but I’m not too concerned about that.
							<br /><br />
							The other aspect of the site is the actual content. I don’t really know what I’m
							talking about but I think the concept of “cards” is on the rise with websites. I’m
							a big fan of the CSS flexbox feature and I had messed around with cards a little
							bit for
							<a class="link" href="/micro" target="_blank">a page on my other site</a>
							so I thought I would make a sort of card carousel to display little teasers of
							each project and then if you want to see more they can take your to their own
							page. While I was looking for the
							<a class="link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a>
							page for flexboxes again I stumbled upon the website
							<a class="link" href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-tricks</a>.
							They have some cards on their site that kind of overlap with each other like a
							real deck of cards. I decided to steal this idea even though it is definitely less
							functional than just having all the cards next to each other. You have to admit it
							does looks pretty cool. <br /><br />The animation of the cards isn’t that
							complicated. They have negative margins and box shadows on one side to give the
							illusion that they’re in a stack. When you hover the mouse it moves up and I used
							the CSS not selector to move all the other cards out of the way. I think cards are
							pretty cool and I’m sure I’ll use them again but I probably won’t end up doing
							this kind of stacking effect again. It’s certainly form over function but I guess
							that’s sort of been a theme of this site. <br /><br />
							I had never used the CSS mask feature before, but it seems like you can really do
							a lot with it. I think I’m definitely gonna end up doing something with that in
							the future but I’m not sure exactly what. At least by my own standards I think
							this website actually came out pretty cool. It’s definitely sparse and I think the
							design may breakdown as it gets more cluttered but I imagine my main site would
							have looked a lot more like this if I had made it knowing what I do now.
